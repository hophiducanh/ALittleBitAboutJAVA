     * Here the output differs. But why? Let’s break down the code and understand it thoroughly.
     *
     * Methods are not static in this code.
     * During compilation, the compiler has no idea as to which print has to be called since compiler goes only by
     * referencing variable not by type of object and therefore the binding would be delayed to runtime and therefore
     * the corresponding version of print will be called based on type on object.

    /**
     * Important Points
     *
     * private, final and static members (methods and variables) use static binding while for virtual methods
     * (In Java methods are virtual by default) binding is done during run time based upon run time object.
     * Static binding uses Type information for binding while Dynamic binding uses Objects to resolve binding.
     * Overloaded methods are resolved (deciding which method to be called when there are multiple methods with same name)
     * using static binding while overridden methods using dynamic binding, i.e, at run time.
