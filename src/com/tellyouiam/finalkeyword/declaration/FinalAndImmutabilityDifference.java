 * final means that you can't change the object's reference to point to another reference or another object,
 * but you can still mutate its state (using setter methods e.g).
 * Where immutable means that the object's actual value can't be changed,
 * but you can change its reference to another one.
 * <p>
 * Concerning the second part of your question (immutability part),
 * the compiler creates a new String object with the value of "Sam", and points the name reference to it.
