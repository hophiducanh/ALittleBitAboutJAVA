Here are a couple of rules for using static imports:
You must say import static; you can’t say static import.
Watch out for ambiguously named static members. For instance, if you do a static import for
both the Integer class and the Long class, referring to MAX_VALUE will cause a compiler error,
because both Integer and Long have a MAX_VALUE constant and Java won’t know which
MAX_VALUE you’re referring to.
You can do a static import on static object references, constants (remember they’re static
and final), and static methods.
