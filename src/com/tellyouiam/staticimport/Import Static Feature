Let’s look at what’s happening in the code that’s using the static import feature:
1. Even though the feature is commonly called “static import,” the syntax MUST be import
static followed by the fully qualified name of the static member you want to import, or a
wildcard. In this case, we’re doing a static import on the System class out object.
2. In this case, we might want to use several of the static members of the java.lang.Integer
class. This static import statement uses the wildcard to say, “I want to do static imports of ALLthe
static members in this class.”
3. Now we’re finally seeing the benefit of the static import feature! We didn’t have to type the
System in System.out.println! Wow! Second, we didn’t have to type the Integer in
Integer.MAX_VALUE. So in this line of code we were able to use a shortcut for a static method
AND a constant.
4. Finally, we do one more shortcut, this time for a method in the Integer class.
