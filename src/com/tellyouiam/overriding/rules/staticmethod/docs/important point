1) For class (or static) methods, the method according to the type of reference is called,
 not according to the object being referred, which means method call is decided at compile time.

2) For instance (or non-static) methods, the method is called according to the type of object being referred,
 not according to the type of reference, which means method calls is decided at run time.

3) An instance method cannot override a static method, and a static method cannot hide an instance method.
 For example, the following program has two compiler errors.
